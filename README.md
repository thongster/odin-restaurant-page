# odin-restaurant-page
The Restaurant Page project from The Odin Project's Javascript Course

This project was all about using webpack to set up our website and also using 100% javascript to dynamically render the DOM, including all content on all the different pages.

The concept for this website was a cafe based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It's a fake restaurant/cafe, but I wanted to treat it real and really practice my CSS  skills with flex, grid, media queries, gradients, images, and more. 

For the menu items, I created an object with different properties and dynamically rendered each property by looping through with forEach. 

Very interesting to render all elements via Javascript. I feel like it opens up a ton of possibilities with what websites can do and I'm excited to learn more.

It was really fun to put together everything we've learned so far to be build the most polished product I've built yet!
